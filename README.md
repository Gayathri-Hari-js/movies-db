# Getting Started with MoviesDB App

MoviesDB is an react application integrated with the tmdb api. \
This application displays popular movies on dashboard and you can search for any movies that you want to watch. \
On selecting a movie you can see the details like overview, crew, ratings, etc.. \
There is a stats page which you can navigate from the header top right graph icon. \
The stats page shows two graphs of 10 polular movies. \
First graph is ratings graph and second one is for number of votings. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
